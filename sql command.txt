2) INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3);      ( If you are adding values for all the columns of the table)


SQL NULL/NOT NULL Values ==>  

1) SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;

2) SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;


SQL UPDATE Statement ==>

1) UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;


SQL DELETE Statement ==>

1) DELETE FROM table_name;                           (Delete All Records)
2) DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;           (DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table)


SQL SELECT TOP Clause ==>

SQL COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() Functions  ==>

1)SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
2)SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
3)SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;


SQL LIKE Operator ==>

   LIKE Operator Description
   WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'	    Finds any values that start with "a";
   WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	    Finds any values that end with "a";
   WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
